This website is a music aggregator that centralizes music from 
SoundCloud and Youtube. It is built with MeteorJS and the Blaze frontend
rendering system.

MediaHub allows you to search through both SoundCloud and YouTube and
save songs to your library. Users can play songs from their library 
in a continuous fashion no matter where the song's data is located.
